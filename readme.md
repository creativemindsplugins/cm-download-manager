⭐ CM Download Manager just got better! The new Setup Wizard and advanced tools make managing your downloads more efficient, while improved customization options give you greater control.

**The WordPress Download Manager plugin is an accessible platform for handling document uploads and downloads, offering a neatly organized directory for file management.**

It allows for a collaborative space where multiple users can engage with and provide input on files, fostering a community spirit. Ideal for managing team documents, sharing with clients, or enabling peer collaboration, this plugin is a top choice for streamlined document management.

## Installation

> [Detailed User Guide](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/category/8-download-manager-cmdm)

1. Transfer the plugin folder into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Go to the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress and activate the plugin.
3. Access and manage your CM Downloads from the Admin Menu on the left.
4. Find all downloads at the `/cmdownloads/` path.
5. The user dashboard can be found at `/cmdownload/dashboard/`.
6. Ensure you create download categories before initiating your first download.

Important: Your theme must include a `wp_head()` function call for the JavaScript plugin files to function correctly. If your theme lacks this feature, you’ll need to integrate these files into your theme manually, which is not the preferred method.

### To customize the plugin’s design:

Establish a `CMDM` folder within your theme’s directory. Mimic the structure found in `cm-download-manager/views/frontend/` inside this new folder. Files in the `CMDM` folder will be prioritized over the default plugin files if they exist.

## Easy File Index

The WordPress Download Manager plugin helps you create a directory with files classified by categories and tags. The index page is highly customizable, so you can configure it according to your needs.

## Custom File Categories

You can set up your own categories with this plugin, which helps you keep your files neat and easy to get to.

The main page also has quick links to all the files you can download, so everything is just a few clicks away.

## More Features with Premium

If you upgrade to the [premium version of the plugin](https://www.cminds.com/wordpress-plugins-library/downloadsmanager/), you can start taking payments with WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads.

It also gives you better tools - shortcodes support, managing zip files, controlling who can see and download files, sending notifications, and keeping an eye on everything.
